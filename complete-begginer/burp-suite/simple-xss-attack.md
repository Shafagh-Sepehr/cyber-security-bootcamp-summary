# simple XSS attack

In a real-world web app pentest, we would test this for a variety of things, one of which would be Cross-Site Scripting (or XSS). If you have not yet encountered XSS, it can be thought of as injecting a client-side script (usually in Javascript) into a webpage in such a way that it executes. There are various kinds of XSS â€“ the type that we are using here is referred to as "Reflected" XSS, as it only affects the person making the web request.

client-side filters are absurdly easy to bypass. There are a variety of ways we could disable the script or just prevent it from loading in the first place.

we just intercept the request and then put the data we want in the request data.

e.g. we put `<script>alert("Succ3ssful XSS")<script>` instead of email and then url encode it with `Ctrl + u`&#x20;
