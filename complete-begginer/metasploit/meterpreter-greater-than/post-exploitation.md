# Post-Exploitation

Commands mentioned previously, such as `getsystem` and `hashdump` will provide important leverage and information for privilege escalation and lateral movement. Meterpreter is also a good base you can use to run post-exploitation modules available on the Metasploit framework. Finally, you can also use the load command to leverage additional tools such as Kiwi or even the whole Python language.

Loading Python

```shell-session
meterpreter > load python
Loading extension python...Success.
meterpreter > python_execute "print 'TryHackMe Rocks!'"
[+] Content written to stdout:
TryHackMe Rocks!

meterpreter >
```



The post-exploitation phase will have several goals; Meterpreter has functions that can assist all of them.

* Gathering further information about the target system.
* Looking for interesting files, user credentials, additional network interfaces, and generally interesting information on the target system.
* Privilege escalation.
* Lateral movement.

Once any additional tool is loaded using the `load` command, you will see new options on the `help` menu. The example below shows commands added for the Kiwi module (using the `load kiwi` command).

{% code title="Loading Kiwi" %}
```shell-session
meterpreter > load kiwi
Loading extension kiwi...
  .#####.   mimikatz 2.2.0 20191125 (x64/windows)
 .## ^ ##.  "A La Vie, A L'Amour" - (oe.eo)
 ## / \ ##  /*** Benjamin DELPY `gentilkiwi` ( benjamin@gentilkiwi.com )
 ## \ / ##       > http://blog.gentilkiwi.com/mimikatz
 '## v ##'        Vincent LE TOUX            ( vincent.letoux@gmail.com )
  '#####'         > http://pingcastle.com / http://mysmartlogon.com  ***/

Success.
```
{% endcode %}

These will change according to the loaded menu, so running the `help` command after loading a module is always a good idea.The updated help menu
