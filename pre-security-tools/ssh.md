# ssh

Short for secure shell, with this command we remotely log in to a machines account.

This connection is secure and encrypted.

`ssh username@IP` is the syntax afterwards we get prompted to enter a password and then we log in to that account.

e.g. `ssh root@45.65.98.102` or `ssh jack@10.15.159.205`
